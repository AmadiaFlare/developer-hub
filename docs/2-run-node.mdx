Running your own node is the most direct way to connect to and interact with the Flare network.
Whether you need to query blockchain data for your application, want to help secure the network by validating transactions, or aim to participate fully in Flare's data protocols, setting up a node is the first step.

This guide covers the different types of nodes you can run - RPC, Validator, and Flare Entity - and provides links to detailed setup instructions for each.

## RPC Node

Allows applications to read blockchain data and submit transactions. Does not participate in consensus. To set up an RPC Node:

1. Check the hardware requirements for running a node.
2. Run the node using either source code or Docker.

      label: "Run with Docker",

    },
  ]}
/>

## Validator Node

Secures the network by validating transactions and participating in consensus. Requires staking FLR. To set up an Validator Node:

1. First set up an [RPC node](#rpc-node).
2. Register the node as a validator.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "Register as Validator",
      href: "run-node/register-validator",
      description: "Register your node as a validator.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Flare Entity

Runs alongside a Validator to provide crucial data for Flare's FTSO and FDC protocols. Required for full reward eligibility. To set up a Flare Entity:

1. First set up a [Validator Node](#validator-node).
2. Follow the Flare Entity guide.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "Flare Entity",
      href: "run-node/flare-entity",
      description: "Provide data for Flare's enshrined data protocols.",
    },
  ]}
/>
