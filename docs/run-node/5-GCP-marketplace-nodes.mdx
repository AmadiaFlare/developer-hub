Deploy blockchain nodes without the need to install dependencies or manage configuration files. The nodes come with a copy of the databases locally which drastically reduces bootstrap times. This product is brought to you at no extra cost. You only need to cover your infrastructure cost with Google Cloud Platform. The machine images will be available for the following networks: Algorand, Avalanche, Bitcoin, Cosmos, Coston/2, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Filecoin, Flare, Polygon, XRP and many more.

## Prerequisites

An account with Google Cloud Marketplace is required. 

In addition to that, a service accounts with the following permissions at the minimum is required, you can either create this before or you can create it during the launch.

- **roles/config.agent**
- **roles/compute.admin**

## Setup 

### Step 1: Find and Launch the Blockchain Machine Image

Click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace) to go to Google Cloud Marketplace and search for Blockchain Machine Image. 

<ThemedImage
    alt="GCP Marketplace website"
    sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/gcp-marketplace/step1-img.png",
    ), 
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/gcp-marketplace/step1-img.png",
    )
  }}
/>


Click on the launch button.

### Step 2: Set Basic Configurations

Select the node, service account, region and network where you want the instance to be created. You can click on the “existing service accounts” button to choose an already existing service account.

<ThemedImage
    alt="GCP Marketplace website"
    sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/gcp-marketplace/step2-img.png",
    ), 
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/gcp-marketplace/step2-img.png",
    )
  }}
/>

Select the network you want the node to be launched in as well as basic firewall rules, then click “Deploy”.

<ThemedImage
    alt="GCP Marketplace website"
    sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/gcp-marketplace/step2-1-img.png",
    ), 
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/gcp-marketplace/step2-1-img.png",
    )
  }}
/>



This will launch a node with the “deployment name”, in the case above, flare-node.

### Step 3: Connect to The Machine

All node operation are performed with the ```nodectl``` command. 

```bash
sudo nodectl help
```

Configuration files can be found in  ```/etc/<node_name>``` folder, for example: ``` /etc/flare ``` .

To start the node, connect to the instance and run apply.


```bash
# applies all services as configured in ``` /etc/<node_name>/config.yaml ```
sudo nodectl apply --target all
```

### How Do I Know Its Working? 

The easiest way to check if the node is working is to utilise the health checks already built into the node. Additionally, some logs can be found in ``` /var/log/<node-name> ``` for example, ``` /var/log/flare ```. 

```bash
# runs health checks
sudo nodectl health
# displays useful information about the node
sudo nodectl status
```

Use ``` nodectl ``` to folow the logs. For all the available options, look at ``` man journalctl ``` 

```bash
sudo nodectl logs -f
```
