Deploy blockchain nodes without the need to install dependencies or manage configuration files. The nodes come with a copy of the databases locally which drastically reduces bootstrap times. The machine images are available for Flare Mainnet, Flare Testnet Coston2, Songbird Canary-Network, Songbird Testnet Coston and several other networks.

Head to [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/flare-public/blockchain-machine-image-flare-network) to get started.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

- A Google Cloud account

- A service account with at least the following permissions (these can be created beforehand or during the launch process):

  - **roles/config.agent**
  - **roles/compute.admin**
  - **roles/iam.serviceAccountUser**

- Verify that the [Quotas and System Limits](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage), located in **IAM and admin > Quotas and system limits**, meet the resource requirements for the intended blockchain node

## Setup a node

1. **Locate and launch the blockchain machine image**

   Head to the [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/flare-public/blockchain-machine-image-flare-network).

   <img src={Step1} style={{ width: 500 }} />

   Click the **Launch** button to proceed.

2. **Configure basic settings**

   Choose the service account, source image, and region for your instance. To use an existing service account, click the **Existing account** button.

   <img src={Step2} style={{ width: 500 }} />

   Next, select the network where the node will be deployed, and configure basic firewall rules. Once done, click **Deploy**. This will launch a node with the deployment name, for example `flare-node`, in the **Compute Engine > VM instances**.

3. **Troubleshooting**

   If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, refer to the [Troubleshooting Section](#troubleshooting) for guidance.

## Connect to the node

Node operations are managed using the `nodectl` CLI tool.

```bash
sudo nodectl help
```

Configuration files are located in the `/etc/<node_name>` directory. For instance, Flare nodes will have their configurations in `/etc/flare`.

To start the node, connect to the instance and apply the services using:

```bash
# Applies all services configured in `/etc/<node_name>/config.yaml`
sudo nodectl apply --target all
```

## Verify node operation

The quickest way to verify that the node is running is by using the built-in health checks.
Logs can also be accessed in the `/var/log/<node_name>` directory, for example, `/var/log/flare`.

```bash
# Run health checks
sudo nodectl health
# Display detailed node information
sudo nodectl status
```

For live log monitoring, use `nodectl`:

```bash
sudo nodectl logs -f
```

For more log options, refer to the `journalctl` manual:

```bash
man journalctl
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Deployment failure due to Terraform state lock**

  - **Symptom**: The deployment fails, and clicking **Retry** leads to Terraform state lock errors.
  - **Solution**: Instead of retrying, delete the failed deployment and start a new one.

- **Deployment failure due to exceeded quotas**

  - **Symptom**: The deployment fails, displaying an error message in the logs similar to:
    ```
    Error: Error waiting for instance to create: Quota 'SSD_TOTAL_GB' exceeded.  Limit: 500.0 in region us-west1.
    metric name = compute.googleapis.com/ssd_total_storage
    limit name = SSD-TOTAL-GB-per-project-region
    limit = 500
    dimensions = map[region:us-west1]
    ```
  - **Solution**: Resource quotas need to be increased manually. To do this, refer to the [Quotas and System Limits documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage) and navigate to **IAM & Admin > Quotas**. After adjusting the quotas, delete the failed deployment and deploy a new one.
