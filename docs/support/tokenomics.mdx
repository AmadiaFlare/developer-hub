Flare's token economics support Flare's ambition to connect the decentralized economy and drive broader adoption of web3. These tokenomics help to create a more balanced playing field where multiple connected ecosystems have an incentive to grow and participate with Flare. The adoption of [FIP.01](https://flare.network/fip01/) on [January 27, 2023](https://portal.flare.network/proposal/view/31313223399225215467886651717691514407244212421129328237186875197531473335173) enabled this approach by changing the mechanism of the public token distribution.

## Token Allocation

At network genesis, 100 billion FLR tokens (100,000,000,000) were created.

:::note
[FIP.01](https://flare.network/fip01/) lowered the initial token supply to 15 billion FLR tokens. Accordingly, the "Initial Supply" means 15 billion FLR tokens, and "Distributed Supply" means 100 billion FLR tokens to be distributed over 36 months via FlareDrop. "Final Supply" means Initial Supply plus Inflation.
:::

These tokens have been allocated to the following groups. Note the delegation, claiming, and voting abilities of each, defined here:

- **Can delegate**: The entity can delegate tokens to the Flare Time Series Oracle to earn standard inflationary rewards.
- **Can claim**: The entity can wrap tokens to claim a portion of the [FlareDrop](../network/guides/manage-flaredrops).
- **Can vote**: The entity can use its tokens to participate in [governance](../network/fsp/governance) by voting on [Flare Improvement Proposals (FIPs)](https://proposals.flare.network/#flare-improvement-proposals-fip).

## Flare Token Utility

Flare is an EVM-based Layer 1 that gives developers decentralized access to data from other chains and the internet.

FLR provides support for each of these functions:

- **Network Security**: Staking to [validator nodes](../run-node/validator-node) to provide network security through proof of stake consensus.
- **Data Provision**: Incentivized delegation to the [Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO)](../ftso/overview).
- **DApp Collateral**: Collateral within decentralized applications built on Flare blockchains.
- **Governance**: Participation within network [governance](../network/fsp/governance).
- **Transaction Fees**: Prevention of spam attacks.

## Public Distribution

The 28,524,921,372 FLR public distribution is split into two parts:

1. The first 15%, the initial Airdrop (4,278,738,206 FLR), was distributed during the Token Distribution Event (TDE) on January 9, 2023 to wallets that held XRP on December 12, 2020.

2. The remaining 85% (24,246,183,166 FLR), the FlareDrop, are being distributed over 36 monthly amounts directly to token holders who have wrapped their FLR into WFLR.

## Inflation Calculation

Annual inflation is calculated based on circulating supply:

- 10% in year 1
- 7% in year 2
- 5% from year 3 onwards

## Vesting Overview

Most token allocations follow a 36-month vesting schedule:

- 15% unlocked at TDE (January 9, 2023)
- Remaining 85% vesting over 36 months:
  - 35 monthly amounts of 2.37% each
  - Final amount of 2.05% in month 36

    light: useBaseUrl("/img/tokenomics/tokenomics-schedule-light.svg"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/tokenomics/tokenomics-schedule-dark.svg"),
  }}
/>

The Flare Team has selling restrictions:

- No sales permitted within the first 6 months
- Maximum 10% of vested tokens permitted to be sold within months 7-12
- Maximum 25% of vested tokens permitted to be sold within months 13-18

## Supply Metrics

- **Initial Supply**: 15B FLR (as specified in FIP.01)
- **Distributed Supply**: 100B FLR (Initial supply + FlareDrop distribution)
- **Total Supply**: Distributed supply + inflation
- **Circulating Supply**: Unlocked distributed tokens
- **Liquid Supply**: Tokens available for sale (circulating supply minus locked tokens)

After the 36-month distribution period, approximately 93.9B FLR will be circulating out of a total 110.1B FLR (including inflation).
