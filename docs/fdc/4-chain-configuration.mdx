## Addresses

### Bitcoin (`Base58`)

Bitcoin addresses use a custom **Base58** encoding dictionary:

```
123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

#### Address Structure

Decoded addresses have the format:

```
<leadingByte><hash><checksum>
```

#### Components

- **`leadingByte`**:
  - On **mainnet**:
    - `00` for Pay-to-PubKey (p2pk) and Pay-to-PubKey-Hash (p2pkh)
    - `05` for Pay-to-Script-Hash (p2sh)
  - On **testnet**:
    - `6f` for p2pk and p2pkh
    - `c4` for p2sh
- **`hash`**: Represents either the public key, hash of the public key, or hash of a script.
- **`checksum`**: The first four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash of `<leadingByte><hash>`.

#### Validation Criteria

1. Address contains only characters from the Base58 dictionary.
2. Decoded hexadecimal form is exactly **25 bytes** long (address length varies between **26 to 34 characters**).
3. Starts with a valid `leadingByte`.
4. The checksum is valid and matches the first four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash.

### Bitcoin (`Bech32`)

Bech32 is a newer address format using the character set:

```
qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l
```

#### Address Structure

A Bech32 address has the following components:

- **Human-Readable Part (HRP)**:
  - `bc` for **mainnet**
  - `tb` for **testnet**
- **Separator**: Always `1`
- **Data Part**:
  - The first character indicates the **witness version** (0-16).
  - The last six characters form a **checksum**.

The checksum differs based on the witness version:

- **Bech32** for witness version `0` ([BIP-0173](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0173))
- **Bech32m** for witness versions `1` to `16` ([BIP-0350](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0350))

#### Validation Criteria

1. Address contains only characters from the Bech32 dictionary.
2. All non-numeric characters must be either entirely uppercase or lowercase.
3. Starts with a valid HRP followed by the separator (`1`).
4. Length is between **14 to 74 characters**, with the length modulo 8 being **0, 3, or 5**.
   - For witness version `0`, length must be **42 or 62 characters**.
5. Checksum is validated based on the witness version.
6. Addresses with witness versions `2` and above are unsupported and invalid.

### Dogecoin (`Base58`)

Dogecoin uses the **Base58** dictionary, identical to Bitcoin's:

```
123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

#### Address Structure

Decoded addresses have the format:

```
<leadingByte><hash><checksum>
```

#### Components

- **`leadingByte`**:
  - On **mainnet**:
    - `1e` for p2pk and p2pkh
    - `16` for p2sh
  - On **testnet**:
    - `6f` for p2pk and p2pkh
    - `71` for p2sh
- **`hash`**: Represents either the public key, hash of the public key, or script hash.
- **`checksum`**: First four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash of `<leadingByte><hash>`.

#### Validation Criteria

1. Address contains only characters from the Base58 dictionary.
2. Length is **26 to 34 characters**. Decoded hex form is **25 bytes**.
3. Valid leading byte:
   - **Mainnet**: Starts with `D`, `A`, or `9`.
   - **Testnet**: Starts with `n`, `m`, or `2`.
4. The checksum is validated.

### XRPL (`Base58`)

The XRP Ledger uses a custom **Base58** dictionary:

```
rpshnaf39wBUDNEGHJKLM4PQRST7VWXYZ2bcdeCg65jkm8oFqi1tuvAxyz
```

#### Address Structure

Decoded to hexadecimal:

```
<leadingByte><publicKeyHash><checksum>
```

#### Components

- **`leadingByte`**:
  - On **mainnet**: `00` (addresses start with `r`).
- **`publicKeyHash`**: A **20-byte** hash of the public key.
- **`checksum`**: The first four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash of `<leadingByte><publicKeyHash>`.

#### Validation Criteria

1. Address contains only characters from the XRPL Base58 dictionary.
2. Length is **25 to 35 characters**. Decoded hex form is **25 bytes**.
3. Address starts with `r`.
4. The checksum is valid.

## Finality

Blockchains have varying confirmation depths to consider blocks as final and safe for bridging to other chains.

| Chain    | `chainId` | Confirmations Required |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| Bitcoin  | 0         | 6                      |
| Dogecoin | 2         | 60                     |
| XRPL     | 3         | 3                      |

## Transactions

### Transaction success status

Transactions on different blockchains have various success statuses. Some blockchains may confirm transactions even if they failed to execute as intended.

| Status             | Code |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| `SUCCESS`          | 0    |
| `SENDER_FAILURE`   | 1    |
| `RECEIVER_FAILURE` | 2    |

#### XRPL

- **`tesSUCCESS`**: Transaction successful.
- **`tec`-class codes**: Indicate reasons for failure, such as:
  - `tecDST_TAG_NEEDED`: Missing required destination tag.
  - `tecNO_DST`: Nonexistent or unfunded destination address.
  - `tecNO_PERMISSION`: Source address lacks permission to send funds.

### Balance decreasing summary

A balance-decreasing summary analyses a transaction that has decreased or could possibly decrease the balance of an account.

A balance-decreasing summary is calculated for a given transaction and source address indicator (`sourceAddressIndicator`).
The summary contains the fields as stated in the table below.
The interpretation of some fields is chain dependent.
Descriptions of these fields are left empty and are later explained for each specific blockchain.

For a given transaction and an address indicator, the balance-decreasing summary can only be calculate if the transaction is considered to be balance-decreasing for the indicated address
When implemented, the function that calculates the balance-decreasing summary
tries to calculate it.
If it is successful, it returns a success status and the summary itself.
If not, it returns an error status.

| Field                      | Description                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactionId`            | -                                                          |
| `transactionStatus`        | [Transaction success status](#transaction-success-status). |
| `sourceAddress`            | -                                                          |
| `spentAmount`              | -                                                          |
| `standardPaymentReference` | [Standard payment reference](#standard-payment-reference). |

The following are detailed descriptions of fields for each supported chain.

#### Bitcoin and Dogecoin

For Bitcoin and Dogecoin, `sourceAddressIndicator` is the index of a transaction input (in hex zero padded on the left to 0x prefixed 32 bytes).
If the input with the given index does not exist or the indicated input does not have an address, no summary is made.
In particular, no summary is made for coinbase transactions.

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactionId` | The transaction ID found in the field `txidz`. For segwit transactions, this is not the same as _hash_.                            |
| `sourceAddress` | Address of the indicated input.                                                                                                    |
| `spentAmount`   | The sum of values of all inputs with `sourceAddress` minus the sum of values of all outputs with `sourceAddress`. Can be negative. |

#### XRPL

For XRPL, `sourceAddressIndicator` is [standardAddressHash](#standard-address-hash) of the indicated address.
If the `sourceAddressIndicator` does not match any of the addresses who signed the transaction or whose balance was decreased by the transaction, the summary is not made.

| Field           |                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactionId` | Hash of the transaction found in the field `hash`.                                                |
| `sourceAddress` | Address whose [standardAddressHash](#standard-address-hash) matches the `sourceAddressIndicator`. |
| `spentAmount`   | The amount for which the balance of the `sourceAddress` has lowered. Can be negative.             |

### Payment summary

The payment summary provides details for transactions involving payments between addresses. Fields include:

| Field               | Description                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `transactionId`     | Unique transaction ID        |
| `transactionStatus` | Transaction success status   |
| `sourceAddress`     | Sender's address             |
| `spentAmount`       | Amount spent by sender       |
| `receivingAddress`  | Recipient's address          |
| `receivedAmount`    | Amount received by recipient |

#### Bitcoin and Dogecoin

- Calculated using UTXO data.
- Relevant for non-coinbase transactions.

#### XRPL

- Applicable only to `Payment` transactions.
- Uses the `tx` method to fetch details.

### Standard payment reference

On blockchains like Bitcoin and XRPL, a 32-byte reference can be added to transactions:

#### Bitcoin

- Uses `OP_RETURN` to store references.

#### XRPL

- Uses the `memoData` field.

### Standard address hash

The **standard address hash** is calculated using the `keccak256` function:

```solidity
keccak256(standardAddress);
```

Example in JavaScript:

```typescript
web3.utils.soliditySha3(standardAddress);
```
