This is a guide on how to build a simple dApp using the [Flare Data Connector](/fdc/overview).
It demonstrates how multiple attestation types, namely the EVMTransaction and JsonApi, can be combined within the same app.

The app that we will be building is called `proofOfReserves`.
We will first describe what issue the app is addressing, and then provide a detailed walkthrough through its source code.
All the code for this project is available on GitHub, in the [Flare Hardhat Starter](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter) repository.

## The task

A stablecoin is a type of token with a fixed value.
One token is guaranteed to always be exchangeable, for example, for one dollar.

The institution backing the token provides a public Web2 API, listing its dollar reserves.
Meanwhile, they also issue tokens on multiple chains.
We want to compare the total token supply, across all chains, with the claimed dollar reserve value.
If the sum of tokens exceeds the claimed reserve amount, the institution is overdrafting its tokens.
That is why we call the app `proofOfReserves`.

Here, we are facing several challenges.
First, how do we acquire data from a public Web2 API?
Second, how can we convert the state data of a contract to an event?
And thirdly, how can we collect the event data from another chain?

The answer to the first and the last question is FDC.
The answer to the second is, that we deploy a contract that, upon being prompted, reads the state data and emits an event with the data included.

This is all the information we need to write our `proofOfReserves` example.

## Smart contracts

To implement our proof of reserves example we will create three contracts.
If this were production code, we would only need two.
But since this is a guide and because we want to be able to play with token supply values, we will also deploy our own stablecoin.

The code that defines the token is as follows.
It is an ERC20 token that is burnable, ownable, and permits the owner to mint more tokens.

```solidity title="contracts/proofOfReserves/Token.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import {ERC20Burnable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol";
import {ERC20Permit} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Permit.sol";
import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyStablecoin is ERC20, ERC20Burnable, Ownable, ERC20Permit {
    constructor(address recipient, address initialOwner)
        ERC20("MyStablecoin", "MST")
        Ownable(initialOwner)
        ERC20Permit("MyStablecoin")
    {
        _mint(recipient, 666 * 10 ** decimals());
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```

Because we are building our app around `@openzeppelin`'s ERC20 token, we can later replace the token with any such instance.
This means that we can easily modify our app to work with an arbitrary contract that inherits the `ERC20`.

The second contract we need to write is the one that reads the total token supply of a given token and emits an event that exposes both the token address and its total supply.
It has a single method that takes an `ERC20` token instance and calls its `totalSupply` function.
Then, it emits the `TotalTokenSupply` event with the token's address and total supply.

```solidity title="contracts/proofOfReserves/TokenStateReader.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract TokenStateReader {
    event TotalTokenSupply(address tokenAddress, uint256 totalSupply);

    function broadcastTokenSupply(ERC20 token) external returns (uint256) {
        emit TotalTokenSupply(address(token), token.totalSupply());
        return token.totalSupply();
    }
}
```

The last contract left to define will check whether the claimed dollar reserves exceed the sum of total token supplies.
Its main function, `verifyReserves`, will take two arguments: an `IJsonApi.Proof` struct, and an array of `IEVMTransaction.Proof` structs.
Then, if the sum of total token supplies is less than the claimed reserves it will return `true`, and `false` otherwise.

```solidity title="contracts/proofOfReserves/ProofOfReserves.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import {IEVMTransaction} from "@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts/coston2/IEVMTransaction.sol";
import {IJsonApi} from "@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts/coston2/IJsonApi.sol";
import {ContractRegistry} from "@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts/coston2/ContractRegistry.sol";
import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

...

contract ProofOfReserves is Ownable {
    event GoodPair(address reader, address token, uint256 totalSupply);
    event BadPair(address reader, address token, uint256 totalSupply);

    uint256 public debugTokenReserves = 0;
    uint256 public debugClaimedReserves = 0;

    mapping(address => address) public tokenStateReaders;

    constructor() Ownable(msg.sender) {}

    function updateAddress(address readerAddress, address tokenAddress) public onlyOwner {
        tokenStateReaders[readerAddress] = tokenAddress;
    }

    function verifyReserves(IJsonApi.Proof calldata jsonProof, IEVMTransaction.Proof[] calldata transactionProofs)
        external
        returns (bool)
    {
        uint256 claimedReserves = readReserves(jsonProof);

        uint256 totalTokenReserves = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < transactionProofs.length; i++) {
            totalTokenReserves += readReserves(transactionProofs[i]);
        }
        debugTokenReserves = totalTokenReserves;

        return totalTokenReserves <= (claimedReserves * 1 ether);
    }
    ...
}
```

At the top of the contract, we see two events and several variables.
The `GoodPair` and `BadPair` events, as well as the `debugTokenReserves` and `debugClaimedReserves` are there for debugging purposes - they will allow us to check those values in the [explorer](https://coston2-explorer.flare.network/).
The `tokenStateReaders` mapping connects each stablecoin to its corresponding `tokenStateReader` contract; it serves as the registry of the official readers.
Therefore, it will only be modifiable by the owner of the `ProofOfReserves` contract (the `updateAddress` function).

Before we can write the readReserves function for the `IJsonAPi.Proof` type, we need to define a `DataTransportObject` struct, as we did in the [JsonApi attestation type guide](/fdc/guides/json-api).
This will later allow us to specify how data from the Web2 API will be stored.
In this case, this will be a single `uint256` field.

```solidity title="contracts/proofOfReserves/ProofOfReserves.sol"
struct DataTransportObject {
    uint256 reserves;
}
```

With that, we simply decode the `abi_encoded_data` within the `IJsonAPi.Proof` struct, and access its `reserves` field.
Of course, we must first validate the proof, but more on that later.

```solidity title="contracts/proofOfReserves/ProofOfReserves.sol:ProofOfReserves"
    function readReserves(IJsonApi.Proof calldata proof) private returns (uint256) {
        require(isValidProof(proof), "Invalid json proof");
        DataTransportObject memory data = abi.decode(proof.data.responseBody.abi_encoded_data, (DataTransportObject));
        debugClaimedReserves = data.reserves;

        return data.reserves;
    }
```

The `readReserves` function for the `IEVMTransaction.Proof` type is more involved.
It cycles through all transaction events and discards those that do not originate with the `tokenStateReader` contract.
It also ignores the ones that belong to a wrong contract, according to the mapping.
In the end, if all the conditions are met, the total supplies are added together.

```solidity title="contracts/proofOfReserves/ProofOfReserves.sol:ProofOfReserves"
    function readReserves(IEVMTransaction.Proof calldata proof) private returns (uint256) {
        require(isValidProof(proof), "Invalid transaction proof");
        uint256 totalSupply = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proof.data.responseBody.events.length; i++) {
            IEVMTransaction.Event memory _event = proof.data.responseBody.events[i];
            address readerAddress = _event.emitterAddress;
            (address tokenAddress, uint256 supply) = abi.decode(_event.data, (address, uint256));
            bool correctTokenAndReaderAddress = tokenStateReaders[readerAddress] == tokenAddress;
            if (correctTokenAndReaderAddress) {
                totalSupply += supply;
                emit GoodPair(readerAddress, tokenAddress, supply);
            } else {
                emit BadPair(readerAddress, tokenAddress, supply);
            }
        }
        return totalSupply;
    }
```

As for validating the proofs, the contracts that do that are quite simple.
Using the `ContractRegistry` library they contact the `FdcVerification` contracts and call the appropriate verify functions.

```solidity title="contracts/proofOfReserves/ProofOfReserves.sol:ProofOfReserves"

    function isValidProof(IJsonApi.Proof calldata proof) private view returns (bool) {
        return ContractRegistry.auxiliaryGetIJsonApiVerification().verifyJsonApi(proof);
    }

    function isValidProof(IEVMTransaction.Proof calldata proof) private view returns (bool) {
        return ContractRegistry.getFdcVerification().verifyEVMTransaction(proof);
    }
```

:::info
The `ContractRegistry` is a library shipped with the `flare-periphery-contracts` that allows for easier access to official Flare contracts.
Instead of acquiring the needed contracts by their addresses, it exposes them through predefined functions.
This approach is less error-prone.
:::

There is one more thing we need to add before we can proceed to the second part of the guide.
While not strictly necessary, it will make one of the future steps much easier.
We will add an empty function that takes a `DataTransportObject` as input.
This will allow us to read the abi signature of the `DataTransportObject` struct from the `ProofOfReserves` contract's artifact.

```solidity title="contracts/proofOfReserves/ProofOfReserves.sol:ProofOfReserves"
    function abiSignatureHack(DataTransportObject calldata dto) external pure {}
```

We name the function appropriately.

## Process Overview

We can also replace the Coston and Coston2 chains with an arbitrary EVM chain.

1. Deploy and verify `MyStablecoin` contract on Coston and Coston2 chains
2. Deploy and verify `TokenStateReader` contract on Coston and Coston2
3. Deploy and verify `ProofOfReserves` contract on Coston2
4. Save `MyStablecoin`, `TokenStateReader`, and `ProofOfReserves` addresses to `scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts`
5. Call the `broadcastTokenSupply` function of both `TokenStateReader` contracts with the corresponding `MyStablecoin` addresses
6. Save transaction hashes of both function calls to `scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts`
7. Request attestation from the FDC, and call `verifyReserves` function of the `ProofOfReserves` with the received data

File names of our scripts will reflect these steps.
At the end of the guide, we will repeat the list with file names instead.

:::warning
We deploy the `ProofOfReserves` on the Coston2 chain only.
:::

## Scripts

The first three scripts each deploy and verify one of the contracts defined in the first part of the guide, ie. `MyStablecoin`, `TokenStateReader`, and `ProofOfReserves`.
They are more or less the same script, the only real difference being the contracts deployed, and the arguments that are passed to their constructor.

The `deployToken.ts` script deploys and verifies the `MyStablecoin` contract on the Coston and Coston2 chain.
Unlike the other two scripts, it also imports an `owner` constant from the `scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts` file.
We provide it with the address of a dummy account, but it should be replaced by the address of the user's account.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/deployToken.ts"
import hre, { run } from "hardhat";
import { MyStablecoinInstance } from "../../typechain-types";
import { owner } from "./config";

const MyStablecoin = artifacts.require("MyStablecoin");

async function deployAndVerify() {
  const args: any[] = [owner, owner];
  const myStablecoin: MyStablecoinInstance = await MyStablecoin.new(...args);
  try {
    await run("verify:verify", {
      address: myStablecoin.address,
      constructorArguments: args,
    });
  } catch (e: any) {
    console.log(e);
  }
  console.log(
    `(${hre.network.name}) MyStablecoin deployed to`,
    myStablecoin.address,
    "\n",
  );
}

deployAndVerify().then((data) => {
  process.exit(0);
});
```

We run this script with the command:

```sh
yarn hardhat run scripts/proofOfReserves/deployToken.ts --network coston \
&& yarn hardhat run scripts/proofOfReserves/deployToken.ts --network coston2
```

The `deployTokenStateReader.ts` deploys and verifies the `TokenStateReader` contract on the Coston and Coston2 chain.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/deployTokenStateReader.ts"
import hre, { run } from "hardhat";
import { TokenStateReaderInstance } from "../../typechain-types";

const TokenStateReader = artifacts.require("TokenStateReader");

async function deployAndVerify() {
  const args: any[] = [];
  const tokenStateReader: TokenStateReaderInstance = await TokenStateReader.new(
    ...args,
  );
  try {
    await run("verify:verify", {
      address: tokenStateReader.address,
      constructorArguments: args,
    });
  } catch (e: any) {
    console.log(e);
  }
  console.log(
    `(${hre.network.name}) TokenStateReader deployed to`,
    tokenStateReader.address,
    "\n",
  );
}

deployAndVerify().then((data) => {
  process.exit(0);
});
```

We run this script with the command:

```sh
yarn hardhat run scripts/proofOfReserves/deployTokenStateReader.ts --network coston \
&& yarn hardhat run scripts/proofOfReserves/deployTokenStateReader.ts --network coston2
```

Finally, the `deployProofOfReserves.ts` script deploys and verifies the `ProofOfReserves` contract on Coston2 chain.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/deployProofOfReserves.ts"
import hre, { run } from "hardhat";
import { ProofOfReservesInstance } from "../../typechain-types";

const ProofOfReserves = artifacts.require("ProofOfReserves");

async function deployAndVerify() {
  const args: any[] = [];
  const proofOfReserves: ProofOfReservesInstance = await ProofOfReserves.new(
    ...args,
  );
  try {
    await run("verify:verify", {
      address: proofOfReserves.address,
      constructorArguments: args,
    });
  } catch (e: any) {
    console.log(e);
  }
  console.log(
    `(${hre.network.name}) ProofOfReserves deployed to`,
    proofOfReserves.address,
    "\n",
  );
}

deployAndVerify().then((data) => {
  process.exit(0);
});
```

We run this script with the command:

```sh
yarn hardhat run scripts/proofOfReserves/deployProofOfReserves.ts --network coston2
```

After we run the three scripts, we save the contract addresses to a `scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts` file.
We define a mapping that specifies what the addresses are for each chain.
Since the `ProofOfReserves` contract is only deployed to a single chain, we do not save it as a mapping.
At the end of the script, we also export these values so that they can be used in other scripts.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts"
const owner = "0xF5488132432118596fa13800B68df4C0fF25131d";

const tokenAddresses = new Map([
  ["coston", "0xb979de129aFA8bBEC5d46314588B573aD9C72db6"],
  ["coston2", "0xfc896CD7115dD2E901a573d11A598d9c8222f58A"],
]);

const readerAddresses = new Map([
  ["coston", "0x16A446c2Bf18421c5d79a21f7Cc3636dFfDB0612"],
  ["coston2", "0xD069D5c27211229afdCc173F2a46cc4aFb320911"],
]);

const proofOfReservesAddress = "0xCe109FE40e1860b7B659DA6C680E931b25d4E445";

...

export {
  owner,
  tokenAddresses,
  readerAddresses,
  proofOfReservesAddress,
  ...
};
```

The next script, `activateTokenStateReader`, calls the `broadcastTokenSupply` method of the `TokenStateReader` contracts on all chains.
It retrieves the address mapping from the `scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts` file and matches them to the current network (the `--network` parameter in the console command).

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/activateTokenStateReader.ts"
import hre from "hardhat";
import { MyStablecoinInstance } from "../../typechain-types";
import { TokenStateReaderInstance } from "../../typechain-types";

import { tokenAddresses, readerAddresses } from "./config";

const MyStablecoin = artifacts.require("MyStablecoin");
const TokenStateReader = artifacts.require("TokenStateReader");


async function main() {
  const network = hre.network.name;
  const tokenAddress = tokenAddresses.get(network);
  const readerAddress = readerAddresses.get(network);
  );

  const transaction = await reader.broadcastTokenSupply(tokenAddress);
  console.log(`(${network}) Transaction id:`, transaction.tx, "\n");
}

main().then((data) => {
  process.exit(0);
});
```

We run this script with the command:

```sh
yarn hardhat run scripts/proofOfReserves/activateTokenStateReader.ts --network coston \
&& yarn hardhat run scripts/proofOfReserves/activateTokenStateReader.ts --network coston2
```

As discussed previously, the `TokenStateReader` contracts each emit an event containing the total token supply.
We save the hashes of transactions where these events were emitted to a mapping in `scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts`.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts"
const owner = "0xF5488132432118596fa13800B68df4C0fF25131d";

const tokenAddresses = new Map([
  ["coston", "0xb979de129aFA8bBEC5d46314588B573aD9C72db6"],
  ["coston2", "0xfc896CD7115dD2E901a573d11A598d9c8222f58A"],
]);

const readerAddresses = new Map([
  ["coston", "0x16A446c2Bf18421c5d79a21f7Cc3636dFfDB0612"],
  ["coston2", "0xD069D5c27211229afdCc173F2a46cc4aFb320911"],
]);

const proofOfReservesAddress = "0xCe109FE40e1860b7B659DA6C680E931b25d4E445";

const transactionHashes = new Map([
  [
    "coston",
    "0x192ff7eb839157d037f023d006aec47afaad6dc8ed98618a5e8803992518caeb",
  ],
  [
    "coston2",
    "0x7149c77b4ecb68ca9faea3991cf24864dc4fbf09c6c52f0c203c748456b80658",
  ],
]);

export {
  owner,
  tokenAddresses,
  readerAddresses,
  proofOfReservesAddress,
  transactionHashes,
};
```

The last script, `verifyProofOfReserves.ts`, is the most advanced.
It performs several steps that amount to the reserves being successfully or unsuccessfully verified.
It first collects all the data and proofs and submits them to the `ProofOfReserves` contract.
The steps are as follows:

1. preparing attestation requests
2. submitting attestation requests to FDC
3. waiting for all voting rounds to finalize
4. retrieving the data and proofs from the DA Layer
5. submitting the data and proofs to the `ProofOfReserves` contract

We first import the addresses from the `scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts` file, and certain settings from environmental variables.
In this scripts, we also heavily utilize helper functions shipped with the `flare-hardhat-starter` repository, (the `scripts/fdcExample/Base.ts` file).
For a detailed breakdown of these functions, look at the Hardhat attestation type guides.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/verifyProofOfReserves.ts"
import hre from "hardhat";
import { ProofOfReservesInstance, IRelayInstance } from "../../typechain-types";
import {
  prepareAttestationRequestBase,
  getFdcHub,
  getFdcRequestFee,
  getRelay,
  calculateRoundId,
  postRequestToDALayer,
  sleep,
} from "../fdcExample/Base";
import {
  tokenAddresses,
  readerAddresses,
  proofOfReservesAddress,
  transactionHashes,
} from "./config";

const ProofOfReserves = artifacts.require("ProofOfReserves");

const {
  VERIFIER_URL_TESTNET,
  VERIFIER_API_KEY,
  JQ_VERIFIER_URL_TESTNET,
  JQ_VERIFIER_API_KEY,
  COSTON2_DA_LAYER_URL,
} = process.env;

...
```

Next, we define an `AttestationRequest` type.
This will allow us to present the request data in a better organized format.
Then, we prepare a list of requests, each populated with the data specified by its corresponding attestation type.
The only two attestation types we need for this example are `IEVMTransaction` and `JsonApi`.
For a more detailed explanation of the included fields, look at the appropriate type specification ([IEVMTransaction](/fdc/attestation-types/evm-transaction) and [JsonApi](/fdc/attestation-types/json-api)).

In this guide, we will be comparing the total supplies of previously deployed tokens (with an arbitrary initial supply of `666`), to the claimed reserves of a real stablecoin.
We will obtain the dollar reserves from the API at the address: `https://api.htdigitalassets.com/alm-stablecoin-db/metrics/current_reserves_amount`.
To the response JSON, we will apply the following JQ filter.

```jq
{reserves: .value | gsub(\",\";\"\") | sub(\"\\\\.\\\\d*\";\"\")}
```

The filter removes all commas (separating thousands), and cuts away the decimal part.
That way, the value we receive will truly be an integer.

We will encode the data as the `DataTransportObject` type, with the following abi signature (expanded to multiple lines for clarity's sake).

```typescript
`{
\"components\": 
  [{
    \"internalType\": \"uint256\",
    \"name\": \"reserves\",
    \"type\": \"uint256\"
  }],
\"internalType\": \"struct DataTransportObject\",
\"name\": \"dto\",
\"type\": \"tuple\"
}`;
```

We have copied the abi signature from the Hardhat-generated artifact of the `abiSignatureHack` function of the `ProofOfReserves` contract.

Since we have deployed the stablecoin contracts to Coston and Coston2, these will be the sources of the transactions.
We read their addresses from the `scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts` file.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/verifyProofOfReserves.ts"
...

type AttestationRequest = {
  source: string;
  sourceIdBase: string;
  verifierUrlBase: string;
  verifierApiKey: string;
  urlTypeBase: string;
  data: any;
};

const requests: AttestationRequest[] = [
  {
    source: "jsonApi",
    sourceIdBase: "WEB2",
    verifierUrlBase: JQ_VERIFIER_URL_TESTNET!,
    verifierApiKey: JQ_VERIFIER_API_KEY!,
    urlTypeBase: "",
    data: {
      apiUrl:
        "https://api.htdigitalassets.com/alm-stablecoin-db/metrics/current_reserves_amount",
      postprocessJq: `{reserves: .value | gsub(\",\";\"\") | sub(\"\\\\.\\\\d*\";\"\")}`,
      abiSignature: `{\"components\": [{\"internalType\": \"uint256\",\"name\": \"reserves\",\"type\": \"uint256\"}],\"internalType\": \"struct DataTransportObject\",\"name\": \"dto\",\"type\": \"tuple\"}`,
    },
  },
  {
    source: "coston",
    sourceIdBase: "testSGB",
    verifierUrlBase: VERIFIER_URL_TESTNET!,
    verifierApiKey: VERIFIER_API_KEY!,
    urlTypeBase: "sgb",
    data: {
      transactionHash: transactionHashes.get("coston")!,
    },
  },
  {
    source: "coston2",
    sourceIdBase: "testFLR",
    verifierUrlBase: VERIFIER_URL_TESTNET!,
    verifierApiKey: VERIFIER_API_KEY!,
    urlTypeBase: "flr",
    data: {
      transactionHash: transactionHashes.get("coston2")!,
    },
  },
];

...
```

If we wanted to include additional sources, we would specify them here.
If the new source were a new chain, no further change to the code would be needed.

We prepare all attestation requests using helper functions from the `flare-hardhat-starter` repository.
We save the returned abi encoded data to a mapping from the source (`jsonApi`, `coston`, and `coston2`) to the data of the corresponding response.

The procedure is enclosed within the `prepareAttestationRequests` function.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/verifyProofOfReserves.ts"
...

async function prepareAttestationRequests(transactions: AttestationRequest[]) {
  console.log("\nPreparing data...\n");
  var data: Map<string, string> = new Map();

  for (const transaction of transactions) {
    console.log(`(${transaction.source})\n`);

    if (transaction.source === "jsonApi") {
      const responseData = await prepareJsonApiAttestationRequest(transaction);
      console.log("Data:", responseData, "\n");
      data.set(transaction.source, responseData.abiEncodedRequest);
    } else {
      const responseData = await prepareTransactionAttestationRequest(
        transaction
      );
      console.log("Data:", responseData, "\n");
      data.set(transaction.source, responseData.abiEncodedRequest);
    }
  }

  return data;
}

...
```

We then submit the abi encoded requests to the FDC, storing the round IDs of each submission to a mapping.
To that end, we define the `submitAttestationRequests` function.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/verifyProofOfReserves.ts"
...

async function submitAttestationRequests(data: Map<string, string>) {
  console.log("\nSubmitting attestation requests...\n");

  const fdcHub = await getFdcHub();
  var roundIds: Map<string, number> = new Map();

  for (const [source, abiEncodedRequest] of data.entries()) {
    console.log(`(${source})\n`);

    const requestFee = await getFdcRequestFee(abiEncodedRequest);
    const transaction = await fdcHub.requestAttestation(abiEncodedRequest, {
      value: requestFee,
    });
    console.log("Submitted request:", transaction.tx, "\n");

    const roundId = await calculateRoundId(transaction);
    console.log(
      `Check round progress at: https://${hre.network.name}-systems-explorer.flare.rocks/voting-epoch/${roundId}?tab=fdc\n`
    );
    roundIds.set(source, roundId);
  }

  return roundIds;
}

...
```

We wait for the voting rounds to finalize, checking every 10 seconds.
Then we collect the data and proof, waiting an additional multiple of 10 seconds if the proof has not been generated yet.
We do so for each source; again we save the result to a mapping.
This logic is contained in the `retrieveDataAndProofs` function.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/verifyProofOfReserves.ts"
...

async function retrieveDataAndProofs(
  data: Map<string, string>,
  roundIds: Map<string, number>
) {
  console.log("\nRetrieving data and proofs...\n");

  var proofs: Map<string, any> = new Map();

  const url = `${COSTON2_DA_LAYER_URL}api/v1/fdc/proof-by-request-round-raw`;
  console.log("Url:", url, "\n");
  for (const [source, roundId] of roundIds.entries()) {
    console.log(`(${source})\n`);

    console.log("Waiting for the round to finalize...");
    // We check every 10 seconds if the round is finalized
    const relay: IRelayInstance = await getRelay();
    while (!(await relay.isFinalized(200, roundId))) {
      await sleep(10000);
    }
    console.log("Round finalized!\n");

    const request = {
      votingRoundId: roundId,
      requestBytes: data.get(source),
    };
    console.log("Prepared request:\n", request, "\n");

    var proof = await postRequestToDALayer(url, request, true);
    console.log("Waiting for the DA Layer to generate the proof...");
    while (proof.response_hex == undefined) {
      await sleep(10000);
      proof = await postRequestToDALayer(url, request, false);
    }
    console.log("Proof generated!\n");

    console.log("Proof:", proof, "\n");
    proofs.set(source, proof);
  }
  return proofs;
}

...
```

Before the data can be used, we must decode it to an appropriate Solidity struct (`IEVMTransaction.Response` and `IJsonAPi.Response` respectively).
We read the abi signature from Hardhat-generated artifacts (`IEVMTransactionVerification._json.abi[0].inputs[0].components[1]` and `IJsonApiVerification._json.abi[0].inputs[0].components[1]`).
Afterwards, we save them as proof structs (`IEVMTransaction.Proof` and `IJsonAPi.Proof`).
The logic is enclosed in `prepareDataAndProofs` function.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/verifyProofOfReserves.ts"
...

async function prepareDataAndProofs(data: Map<string, any>) {
  const IJsonApiVerification = await artifacts.require("IJsonApiVerification");
  const IEVMTransactionVerification = await artifacts.require(
    "IEVMTransactionVerification"
  );

  const jsonProof = {
    merkleProof: data.get("jsonApi").proof,
    data: web3.eth.abi.decodeParameter(
      IJsonApiVerification._json.abi[0].inputs[0].components[1],
      data.get("jsonApi").response_hex
    ),
  };
  var transactionProofs: any[] = [];
  for (const [source, proof] of data.entries()) {
    if (source !== "jsonApi") {
      const decodedProof = web3.eth.abi.decodeParameter(
        IEVMTransactionVerification._json.abi[0].inputs[0].components[1],
        proof.response_hex
      );
      transactionProofs.push({
        merkleProof: proof.proof,
        data: decodedProof,
      });
    }
  }

  return [jsonProof, transactionProofs];
}

...
```

The final function, `submitDataAndProofsToProofOfReserves` function, interacts with the `ProofOfReserves` contract to verify stablecoin reserves.
First, it accesses the latter at the specified address (imported from `scripts/proofOfReserves/config.ts`).
It then updates the registered `MyStablecoin` and `TokenStateReader` addresses.
Lastly, it submits all the data and proofs to the `ProofOfReserves` contract.

```typescript title="scripts/proofOfReserves/verifyProofOfReserves.ts"
...

async function submitDataAndProofsToProofOfReserves(data: Map<string, any>) {
  const proofOfReserves: ProofOfReservesInstance = await ProofOfReserves.at(
    proofOfReservesAddress
  );

  for (const source of tokenAddresses.keys()) {
    await proofOfReserves.updateAddress(
      readerAddresses.get(source),
      tokenAddresses.get(source)
    );
  }

  const [jsonProof, transactionProofs] = await prepareDataAndProofs(data);

  await proofOfReserves.verifyReserves(jsonProof, transactionProofs);
  const sufficientReserves: boolean = true;
  return sufficientReserves;
}

...
```
