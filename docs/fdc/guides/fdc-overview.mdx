The Flare Data Connector bridges the gap between different blockchains, enabling the smooth exchange of information and synchronization of smart contracts and state changes

## Attestation types

FDC currently supports seven attestation types, each serving specific verification needs.
Below is an overview of these types, with detailed explanations available in their respective sections:

- **AddressValidity**: Validates the format and checksum of addresses on specified chains
- **EVMTransaction**: Verifies and retrieves transaction details from EVM-compatible chains (`ETH`, `FLR`, `SGB`)
- **JsonApi**:
  {/* TODO */}
- **Payment**: Confirms and fetches payment transaction details from non-EVM chains (`BTC`, `DOGE`, `XRP`)
- **ConfirmedBlockHeightExists**: Verifies block existence and confirmation status
- **BalanceDecreasingTransaction**: Validates if a transaction reduces an address's balance
- **ReferencedPaymentNonexistence**: Confirms absence of specific payments within time intervals

The first three types are the most generally useful, while the last three are used mostly in FAssets.

## FDC workflow

For all six attestation types, the workflow follows the same general steps.
Because of the waiting period between steps 2. and 3., in which the round is finalized, we have split have the process into multiple sections.

1.  **Preparing the attestation request (off-chain).**
    We post the attestation request by calling the `requestAttestation` method on the `FdcHub` contract.
    To do so we provide to it as a parameter a properly-formed ABI encoded data.
    We can prepare the data manually, or generate it through a verifier server; the following steps describe the second method.
    1.  **Preparing the request.**
        We provide the request data, as is specified in the [specifications](docs/fdc/3-attestation-types.mdx) (the data is different for each attestation type).
        The request is formatted as a JSON string.
    2.  **Posting the request to a verifier server.**
        We send the request to a verifier server, which checks its validity.
        The server returns a JSON response containing two fields: the validity of the request and its ABI encoding.
2.  **Submitting the request to the FDC contract (on-chain).**
    We extract an ABI encoded request from the verifier server's response.
    We then provide this data as a parameter to a `requestAttestation` method call on the `FdcHub` contract.
3.  **Retrieving the data and proof (off-chain).**
    We retrieve the data and proof from a chosen DA Layer provider. Then we can verify the proof through FDC.
    1.  **Waiting for the response.**
        We wait for the current voting round to finalize, which takes no more than 135 seconds.
        {/* TODO link to description of how this works */}
    2.  **Preparing the proof request.**
        We prepare a JSON request, containing the ID of the voting round in which our attestation took place, and the ABI encoded request data produced in the previous step.
        This request is the same for all attestation types.
    3.  **Posting the proof request to a Data Availability (DA) Layer provider.**
        We post the JSON request to a server of the chosen DA Layer provider.
        The server returns a JSON string response.
        The DA Layer's response is a JSON string with fields specified in the [specifications](https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/docs-team/flare-specs/-/tree/main/src/FDC/AttestationTypes?ref_type=heads) for each attestation type.
        We decode the response to an appropriate struct, determined by the attestation type.
        We can then access the data.
4.  **Using the data (on-chain).**
    We use the data by passing the struct with DA Layer's response to custom contract.
    This step can be executed as soon as we receive the response from the DA Layer.

:::note
The initial request preparation steps generate a standardized ABI-encoded request string.
This encoding enables FDC to handle all attestation types through a single `requestAttestation` function, promoting protocol efficiency and maintainability.
