The **Verifiable AI Hackathon** is designed to push the boundaries of **verifiable off-chain compute** using **Flare's infrastructure** and **Google Cloud Confidential Compute**. Participants will develop **trusted AI agents** capable of performing **secure, attested computation** while ensuring **data integrity, privacy, and on-chain verifiability**.

This hackathon brings together **blockchain developers, AI researchers, and security engineers** to build applications that combine **AI, trusted execution environments (TEEs), and decentralized verifiability**.

## Why Verifiable AI?

Blockchains are **inefficient at high-performance compute and data storage** due to **gas constraints, lack of floating-point operations, and on-chain state limitations**. To enable **scalable AI** within decentralized applications, this hackathon leverages **Google Cloud Confidential VM** in combination with Flare’s **data protocols**.

### Key Advantages:

- **Verifiable Compute:** Ensures computations are executed correctly inside a **TEE**, providing cryptographic proofs of execution.
- **AI + Blockchain:** Uses **Flare's decentralized oracles** and **data connectors** to integrate AI decision-making into **trustless environments**.
- **Confidentiality:** Secure execution via **Google Cloud Confidential Compute**, protecting **model integrity and sensitive data**.
- **Decentralized Deployment:** Participants will **integrate AI models** into blockchain applications with **on-chain verification mechanisms**.

## Hackathon Structure

The event is structured around **four challenge tracks**, each emphasizing a different **verifiable AI application**:

1. **Social AI Agent Track:** Develop **autonomous AI agents** that can interact with **social media and blockchain applications** in a verifiable and trustless manner.
2. **RAG Knowledge Track:** Implement **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) AI systems** using **Flare’s developer resources** and **BigQuery datasets**.
3. **AI x DeFi (DeFAI) Track:** Create **AI-powered DeFi assistants** that execute **on-chain transactions securely** using natural language commands.
4. **Consensus Learning Track:** Build **multi-model AI ensembles** that reach consensus on **predictions, decisions, or forecasts** in a decentralized and provable manner.

## Infrastructure

The hackathon provides **pre-built resources** to accelerate development:

- **Confidential Compute VMs** (Google Cloud)
- **Flare Data Protocols** (Flare Time Series Oracle, Flare Data Connector)
- **BigQuery Datasets** (FTSO Latency Feeds, GitHub Activity, Google Trends)
- **Pre-configured AI Models** (Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, AI Embeddings)

## Next Steps

To get started, participants must **onboard onto the hackathon infrastructure** and configure **Google Cloud Confidential Compute environments**. For setup instructions, see the **Participant Onboarding** section.
