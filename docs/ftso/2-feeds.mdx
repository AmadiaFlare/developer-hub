FTSOv2's block-latency feeds update incrementally with each new block on Flare, approximately every 1.8 seconds. Every feed leverages Flare's network of 100 independent data providers. These feeds primarily support cryptocurrency price data and are free to query on Flare, enabling decentralized applications to access up-to-date information without incurring additional costs.

You can query block-latency feeds onchain using two equivalent methods:

- **By Feed Index**:

  Use the functions `getFeedByIndex` or `getFeedsByIndex` to query feeds by their index.

  **OR**

- **By Feed ID**:

  Use the functions `getFeedById` or `getFeedsById` to query feeds by their ID.

:::warning

Feed IDs are not addresses. They are `bytes21` structured encodings that combine the category and feed name to ensure each feed has a unique identifier.

## Need more feeds?

Block-latency feeds are just one subset of the feeds available on Flare. If you need additional feeds beyond what is currently available, you can raise a [New Feed Request Issue](https://github.com/flare-foundation/developer-hub/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

When a feed request is submitted, it is reviewed by the FTSO Management Group, which is comprised of the FTSO data providers as outlined in [FIP.08](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_8.html#222-through-the-ftso-management-group).

- [Read feeds offchain](./guides/read-feeds-offchain) in languages like JavaScript, Python, Rust, and Go.
- [Change quote feed](./guides/change-quote-feed) using an onchain Solidity contract.
