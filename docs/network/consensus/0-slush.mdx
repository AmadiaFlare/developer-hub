**Slush** serves as the foundational protocol in the Snow family.
In Slush, a node repeatedly samples the network and queries each selected peer regarding its current preferred state.
The protocol is governed by two parameters:

- `K`: the number of nodes included in each sample.
- `Alpha`: the minimum threshold—constrained such that `K/2 < Alpha <= K`—required for a query to be considered successful.
  That is, at least `Alpha` nodes must support the same state.

When a query is deemed successful -- i.e., it garners at least `Alpha` votes in favor of a particular state -- the node updates its own preference to match the majority state of the sample.
The original formulation of Slush was defined for a binary decision scenario.
The image below depicts such a binary decision example, where a user samples the network, queries the sampled participants, and updates its preferred state accordint to the majority.
The example uses `K=5` and `Alpha=3` for the protocol parameters.

Slush does not incorporate inherent fault tolerance.
This limitation is evident in its termination process, as the algorithm executes for a predetermined number of rounds rather than terminating based on reaching a consensus resilient against Byzantine faults.

The Slush algorithm is implemented as part of the [go-flare](https://github.com/flare-foundation/go-flare) client, within the [snow/consensus/snowball](https://github.com/flare-foundation/go-flare/tree/main/avalanchego/snow/consensus/snowball) package.
The global parameters are defined as part of the [genesis configuration](https://github.com/flare-foundation/go-flare/tree/main/avalanchego/genesis).
