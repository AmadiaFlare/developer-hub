Flare governance empowers the community by providing a structured process for decision-making across the Flare and Songbird networks.
This governance framework plays a crucial role in decentralization and allows participants to:

- Propose policy changes
- Vote on them
- Execute approved proposals

## Proposal Types and Networks

On Flare Mainnet and Songbird Canary-Network, proposals can originate from different sources, resulting in two categories:

- **Foundation-initiated proposals** (currently supported)

- **Community-initiated proposals** (to be introduced in the future)

These categories give rise to four proposal types, with the following two currently active:

### Flare Improvement Proposals (FIPs)

- **Network**: Flare
- **Initiator**: Flare Foundation
- **Default Status**: Rejected by default
- **Voting Tokens**: `WFLR` (wrapped FLR)
- **Approval Condition**: Simple majority vote in favor
- **Quorum Requirement**: None

FIPs are proposed enhancements designed to improve the stability of the Flare network.
They follow an acceptance-based voting process, where approval requires a simple majority of cast votes to be in favor.

### Songbird Test Proposals (STPs)

- **Network**: Songbird
- **Initiator**: Flare Foundation
- **Default Status**: Accepted by default
- **Voting Tokens**: `WSGB` (wrapped SGB)
- **Rejection Conditions**:
  - **Threshold**: At least 75% of all circulating `SGB` tokens must participate
  - **Majority**: More than 50% of votes must be against the proposal
- **Outcome**: STPs are accepted unless both rejection conditions are met

STPs allow rapid testing of proposals on Songbird before their implementation on Flare.
If either the quorum threshold is not met or fewer than half of the votes cast are against, the proposal is accepted.

## Voting Process

### Eligibility and Vote Power

To participate in governance, users must hold wrapped tokens. Voting power is determined by the number of wrapped tokens a user possesses:

| Network  | Proposal Type | Token | Wrapped Token |
| -------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Flare    | FIP           | `FLR` | `WFLR`        |
| Songbird | STP           | `SGB` | `WSGB`        |

The Flare Foundation announces proposals in advance, allowing users to wrap their tokens before voting begins.

### Vote Transfer

Users can transfer their voting power to another address while retaining ownership of their wrapped tokens. This feature is useful for consolidating votes across multiple self-custody wallets.

- Votes can be transferred to a single address but received from multiple addresses.

- Transferred votes cannot be further delegated.

- Once activated, all votes from an account are transferred to the designated address until the delegation is canceled.

**Example**: If an account holds 100 WSGB and enables vote delegation, it transfers 100 votes. If an additional 100 WSGB is acquired later, the delegation automatically transfers 200 votes in the next proposal.

### Vote Count Block

Since token balances fluctuate, a snapshot of all accounts is taken before voting starts.
This snapshot, known as the **vote count block**, determines the number of votes an account can cast.

To encourage active participation and prevent strategic acquisition of tokens solely for voting, the vote count block is selected randomly.

### Voting Procedure

The governance voting process follows a structured sequence:

1. **Proposal Announcement:** The Flare Foundation publishes proposals on the [Flare website](https://flare.network) and social media (see footer for links).

2. **Notice Period:** A minimum one-week window allows for discussion, clarifications, and potential cancellation of flawed proposals.

3. **Block Selection Period:** The vote count block is selected randomly within this timeframe.

4. **Voting Period:** Voting occurs on the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) and lasts one week. Results are published at the conclusion.

The voting process follows these key principles:

- **Threshold condition:** Some proposals require a minimum quorum for validity.

- **Majority condition:** More than 50% of votes cast must support or oppose the proposal.

## Proposal Execution

Once a proposal is accepted, execution occurs based on its implementation method:

- **Smart Contract Execution:** Governance contracts enable automatic execution through contract calls.

- **Manual Execution:** Proposals requiring off-chain actions are executed by the Flare Foundation.

- **Future Automation:** Over time, additional automation mechanisms may be introduced.

## Relation to Flare Systems Protocol

The Flare Systems Protocol (FSP) incorporates governance mechanisms across multiple sub-protocols:

- [Signing Policy Definition Protocol](/network/fsp/system-protocols#signing-policy-definition-protocol): Ensures secure transitions between reward epochs.
- [Reward Voting Protocol](/network/fsp/system-protocols#reward-voting-protocol): Enables collective validation of reward distributions.
- **Other Specialized Protocols:** Various mechanisms support governance for specific network functions.

These governance structures, combined with FIP and STP processes, ensure a comprehensive approach to decision-making within the Flare ecosystem.
