# Governance

## Introduction

Flare governance enables everyone in the ecosystem to collaborate on decision-making for the Flare and Songbird networks, making governance a crucial element of decentralization.

This process allows the Flare Foundation and community members to:

- Propose policy changes
- Vote on these proposals
- Execute them if accepted

## Networks and Proposal Types

Excluding the testnets Coston and Coston2, Flare currently has two networks: Flare and Songbird.

Two kinds of proposals exist, depending on the initiator:

- Foundation-initiated proposals
- Community-initiated proposals (to be supported in the future)

This structure leads to four types of proposals, with only two currently supported:

### Flare Improvement Proposals (FIPs)

- **Network**: Flare
- **Initiator**: Flare Foundation
- **Default Status**: Rejected by default
- **Voting Tokens**: `$WFLR` (wrapped FLR)
- **Approval Condition**: Simple majority of votes must be in favor
- **Quorum Requirement**: None

FIPs are designed to improve stability and require explicit acceptance through voting.

### Songbird Test Proposals (STPs)

- **Network**: Songbird
- **Initiator**: Flare Foundation
- **Default Status**: Accepted by default
- **Voting Tokens**: `$WSGB` (wrapped SGB)
- **Rejection Conditions**:
  - **Threshold**: At least 75% of all circulating `$SGB` tokens must participate
  - **Majority**: More than 50% of votes must be against the proposal
- **Outcome**: STPs are accepted unless both rejection conditions are met

STPs facilitate rapid testing of new proposals on Songbird before implementation on Flare.

## Voting Process

### Eligibility and Vote Power

To participate in governance voting:

- You must have wrapped tokens (`$WFLR` for Flare or `$WSGB` for Songbird)
- Your vote power equals the number of wrapped tokens you hold
- Tokens must be wrapped **before** the proposal is submitted
- Keep some unwrapped tokens for transaction fees

!!! warning
Native tokens (`$FLR` or `$SGB`) do not contribute to vote power. Remember to wrap your tokens before the voting period.

### Vote Count Block

A snapshot of all accounts is taken at a randomly selected block before each voting period starts. This snapshot determines the vote power each account can exercise during the vote.

The random selection encourages users to maintain their tokens in the network rather than acquiring them solely for voting purposes.

### Voting Timeline

The governance process follows these stages:

1. **Announcement**: The Flare Foundation publishes the proposal and announces it through official channels.

2. **Notice Period**: A discussion period (typically one week) before voting begins, allowing for clarification and feedback.

3. **Block Selection Period**: A random period during which the vote count block is selected.

4. **Voting Period**: The proposal becomes available on the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network) for one week of voting.

### Vote Transfer

Votes can be transferred to another account while maintaining ownership of the wrapped tokens. This feature simplifies voting for users with multiple wallets by allowing them to consolidate voting power in a single wallet.

Key aspects of vote transfer:

- Transfers can only be sent to one address
- An address can receive votes from multiple sources
- Received votes cannot be transferred again
- Vote transfers automatically send 100% of an account's votes
- Transfers remain active until explicitly canceled
- New wrapped tokens automatically contribute to transferred votes

!!! note
Vote transfer is independent from FTSO delegation. Wrapped tokens can be delegated to an FTSO data provider while their voting power is transferred to a different address.

## Proposal Execution

Once a proposal is accepted:

- Flare's governance contracts enable automatic execution via contract calls
- Some proposals that cannot be implemented through smart contracts are manually executed by the Flare Foundation
- Both FIPs and STPs are currently manually executed by the Foundation

## Relation to FSP

The Flare Systems Protocol (FSP) incorporates governance mechanisms through its various sub-protocols:

- The **Signing Policy Definition Protocol** ensures secure transitions between reward epochs
- The **Reward Voting Protocol** allows voters to collectively validate reward distributions
- Various sub-protocols enable specialized governance for specific network functions

These mechanisms work alongside the broader FIP and STP processes to enable comprehensive governance of the Flare ecosystem.
