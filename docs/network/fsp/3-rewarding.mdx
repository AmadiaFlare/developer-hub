Flare's sub-protocols utilize a uniform signing weight for decision-making; however, reward distribution is based on the delegators' participation weights. Each sub-protocol calculates rewards for various participation weight types, allowing delegators to claim rewards according to their specific contribution shares.

All rewards are managed through the [`RewardManager`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRewardManager) contract and are claimable after the reward epoch concludes. Sub-protocols implement their own contracts to gather rewarding inputs, which are passed to the Reward Manager for distribution. Funding is provided by sub-protocol-specific contracts, which may also handle inflation-based rewards through automated offers.

## Minimal Conditions

The [FIP.10](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_10.html) and [SIP.04](http://proposals.flare.network/SIP/SIP_4.html) governance proposals introduced an incentive structure for participating in all protocols.
The proposals implemented a set of minimum participation requirements from the data providers in a reward epoch for all Flare protocols.
Failure to meet **all** these requirements can ultimately lead to loss of rewards across all protocols.

### Passes

The incentive structure introduces the concept of **passes**.
Each provider has a number of passes, and can gain or lose passes depending on whether they meet the minimum participation requirements for each protocol.

- Newly registered data providers start with zero passes.
- When a data provider meets the minimum requirements in a reward epoch, they gain a pass.
  Providers can hold a maximum of 3 passes.
- When a data provider fails to meet the minimum requirements in a reward epoch, they lose a pass.
  Providers can lose one pass per protocol per reward epoch.
- If a provider would lose a pass but doesnâ€™t have any, they lose all rewards for the epoch.
  That is, a provider with 1 pass who fails to meet 1 minimal requirement will have 0 passes but will still achieve rewards, and a provider with 0 passes who fails to achieve a minimal requirement loses all rewards.

### Minimum Participation Requirements

Each Flare protocol implements the minimum participation requirements, defined across each reward epoch independently.
FTSO and Staking requirements were introduced in [FIP.10](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_10.html), while FDC requirements were defined in [FIP.12](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_12.html).
For completeness, these are also listed below:

- **Staking**: Providers must meet 80% total uptime in the reward epoch with at least 1M FLR in active self-bond.
  However, in order to earn passes, the provider must have at least 3M FLR in active self-bond and 15M in active stake.
  Providers with 80% total uptime and at least 1M FLR in active self-bond but not meeting both the 3M FLR active self-bond and 15M active stake requirements neither earn nor lose passes, and still receive eligible rewards.

- **FTSO anchor feeds**: Providers must submit a value estimate that lies within a 0.5% band around the consensus median value in 80% of voting rounds within a reward epoch.

- **FTSO block-latency feeds**: Providers must submit at least 80% of their expected number of updates within a reward epoch, unless they have very low weight, defined as < 0.2% of the total active weight.

- **FDC**: Data providers must successfully participate in 60% of all voting rounds within a reward epoch.
  That is, they must submit the correct Merkle root for that voting epoch.

## Claim Structure

Rewards are distributed through **reward claims**, which are data records indicating the allocation of rewards. Each claim consists of the following fields:

- `rewardEpochId`: Identifier for the reward epoch.
- `beneficiary`: The reward recipient, specified by address or node ID (20 bytes).
- `amount`: Reward amount in FLR.
- `claimType`: The category of the reward claim, which can be one of the following:
  - `direct`: Rewards directly attributed to the beneficiary (address). Used for undistributed rewards, fund providers, burn claims, or specific rewarding approaches within sub-protocols.
  - `fee`: Similar to 'direct' but specific to eligible voters. Covers delegation fees (WFLR) and node staking fees.
  - `wflr`: Rewards for eligible voters, distributed to delegators based on their participation in WFLR.
  - `mirror`: Rewards distributed to delegators based on their participation in WM.
  - `cchain`: Rewards for eligible voters, distributed based on their share in WC.

Weight-based claims (`wflr`, `mirror`, `cchain`) represent total rewards for voters, to be distributed according to the delegators' participation in the voters' weight.

## Calculation Process

Each sub-protocol is responsible for calculating its partial reward claims for each reward epoch by:

1. **Data Input**: Determining the relevant data sources (indexers).
2. **Data Retrieval**: Querying data from indexers.
3. **Reward Calculation**: Implementing reward algorithms to produce partial reward claims.

**Partial reward claims** may have a negative amount if penalization is applied. The **Reward Voting Protocol** aggregates these partial claims into a single claim per beneficiary and type. The final claims are structured into a Merkle tree, and the Merkle root is confirmed through a voting process.

## Claiming Process

Once the Merkle root is confirmed for a reward epoch, rewards can be claimed via the **Reward Manager contract**:

- For `direct` or `fee` claims, rewards are transferred directly to the beneficiary upon proof verification.
- For **weight-based claims**, the process involves two steps:
  1. **Initialization**: Submission of a reward claim with a Merkle proof to initialize variables.
  2. **Delegator Claims**: Delegators can then claim their share without needing additional proofs.

Once initialized, delegators can claim rewards through the Reward Manager contract. The reward for a delegator `x` is calculated as:

$$
\text{reward} = \frac{U_{T,r,b}^{amount} \times w(r, T, x, b)}{U_{T,r,b}^{weight}}
$$

where:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- $ U_{T,r,b}^{weight} $ is the unclaimed delegation weight for reward epoch $r$ and beneficiary $b$.
{/* prettier-ignore */}
- $ U_{T,r,b}^{amount} $ is the unclaimed reward amount for reward epoch $r$ and beneficiary $b$.
- $ w(r, T, x, b) $ is the weight delegated by $x$ to $b$ for weight type $T$ during reward epoch $r$.
- The claimed reward reduces the unclaimed amount and weight, and the payout is made directly to $x$.

## Incentivizing Fast Signing and Finalization

Sub-protocols are designed to encourage fast signature deposition and finalization:

1. **Finalization Rewards**:

   - The first entity to finalize a Merkle root earns the reward.
   - To avoid centralization, rewards prioritize eligible voters and distribute based on their weight.
   - A grace period (20s) allows selected data providers to finalize or attempt finalization before others.

2. **Signing Deposition Rewards**:
   - Voters submitting signatures within a grace period (10s) receive rewards.
   - Signatures submitted until the block of finalization are also rewarded if they meet weight thresholds.

### Finalization Incentives

During the **grace period** for finalization (20s), selected data providers are rewarded based on a pseudo-random selection algorithm:

- A hash value is used to determine which voters are eligible for finalization rewards based on their signing weight.
- Voters are selected in proportion to their weights, and rewards are distributed among them.

If finalization is not completed within the grace period, the first to finalize receives the full reward, provided it happens within the extended reward window (`i + 2` voting epochs).

### Claim Generation and Reward Distribution

Each sub-protocol allocates rewards for:

1. **Finalization**: Rewards for submitting sufficient signatures to finalize a Merkle root.
2. **Signing Deposition**: Rewards for voters who timely submit valid signatures.

The reward amount attributed to a voter is split into:

- **Fee Claims**: Deducted as delegation fees (WNat delegations).
- **Weight Participation Claims**: Remaining rewards are distributed among delegators and stakers based on their weights.
