On Flare networks, contract addresses for enshrined protocol components such as `FtsoV2`, `FdcHub`, and `RandomNumberV2` should always be retrieved from the **Flare Contract Registry** dynamically.
This ensures you are using trusted, up-to-date addresses without relying on off-chain or potentially harmful sources.

### Registry Contract Address

All core contract addresses can be retrieved from the [`FlareContractRegistry`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry) smart contract.
This is the **only trusted source** of official contract addresses on Flare.

The registry is deployed at the same address across all supported Flare networks:

| [FlareContractRegistry](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry) | `0xaD67FE66660Fb8dFE9d6b1b4240d8650e30F6019` |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

:::warning
- Never hardcode contract addresses in production.
- Avoid using contract addresses obtained from unofficial sources like DMs, social media, or third-party websites.
- Instead of passing contract addresses directly into constructors, retrieve them dynamically as shown below.
:::

## Retrieving Addresses from the Registry

The registry exposes [`getContractAddressByName`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry#getcontractaddressbyname) or [`getContractAddressByHash`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry#getcontractaddressbyhash) to retrieve the address of the contract you need.

In the following example, the `RandomNumberFetcherViaRegistry` contract retrieves the address of `RandomNumberV2` via the registry:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="contracts/RandomNumberFetcherViaRegistry.sol">
  {RandomNumberFetcherViaRegistry}
</CodeBlock>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Remix fileName="RandomNumberFetcherViaRegistry.sol">Open in Remix</Remix>

## Using the Contract Registry Library

The [`@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts) package includes a [`ContractRegistry`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-solidity-periphery-package-mirror/blob/master/flare/ContractRegistry.sol) library.
This library provides convenient shorthand methods to access frequently used contract interfaces without manually specifying their names.

For example, the `RandomNumberFetcherViaLibrary` contract below uses `ContractRegistry.getRandomNumberV2()` to access the `RandomNumberV2` contract directly:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="contracts/RandomNumberFetcherViaLibrary.sol">
  {RandomNumberFetcherViaLibrary}
</CodeBlock>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Remix fileName="RandomNumberFetcherViaLibrary.sol">Open in Remix</Remix>
<br></br>

:::tip
If the contract you're looking for does not have a shorthand method in the `ContractRegistry` library, you can fall back to using `getContractAddressByName` or call `getAllContracts` to list all registered contracts.

By following either of these patterns, you ensure that your dApps and smart contracts are more maintainable, secure, and future-proof when working within the Flare ecosystem.
