On Flare networks, contract addresses for enshrined protocol components such as `FtsoV2`, `FdcHub`, `WNat`, and others **should never be hardcoded**.
Instead, use the **Flare Contract Registry** to retrieve them dynamically.

:::warning
Developers should never rely on contract addresses from off-chain sources like direct messages, social media, or unofficial websites. These addresses may point to malicious contracts.
:::

## Retrieving Addresses from the Blockchain

All core contract addresses can be retrieved from the [`FlareContractRegistry`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry) smart contract.  
This is the **only trusted source** of contract addresses provided in Flare documentation.

### Registry Contract Address

The Flare Contract Registry is deployed at the same address on [all networks](/network/solidity-reference):

| [FlareContractRegistry](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry) | `0xaD67FE66660Fb8dFE9d6b1b4240d8650e30F6019` |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

### Solidity Example

You can use the following helper contract to fetch a contract address by name:

<CodeBlock
  language="solidity"
  title="contracts/FlareContractRegistryReader.sol"
>
  {FlareContractRegistryReader}
</CodeBlock>

Deploy this contract to one of Flare Networks and use the `0xaD67FE66660Fb8dFE9d6b1b4240d8650e30F6019` address for the `flareContractRegistry` variable.

#### Usage Example

To retrieve the address of the `FtsoV2` contract:

```solidity
FlareContractRegistryReader.getContractAddressByName("FtsoV2");
```

### List of Available Contracts

To retrieve all available enshrined contract names, use the `getAllContracts` method:

```solidity
FlareContractRegistryReader.getAllContracts();
```
