On Flare networks, contract addresses for enshrined protocol components such as `FtsoV2`, `FdcHub`, `WNat`, and others **should never be hardcoded**.
Instead, use the **Flare Contract Registry** to retrieve them dynamically.

:::warning
Developers should never rely on contract addresses from off-chain sources like direct messages, social media, or unofficial websites.
These addresses may point to malicious contracts.

## Retrieving Addresses from the Blockchain

All core contract addresses can be retrieved from the [`FlareContractRegistry`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry) smart contract.  
This is the **only trusted source** of contract addresses provided in Flare documentation.

### Registry Contract Address

The Flare Contract Registry is deployed at the same address on [all networks](/network/solidity-reference):

| [FlareContractRegistry](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry) | `0xaD67FE66660Fb8dFE9d6b1b4240d8650e30F6019` |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

## Contract Registry Library

[Flare periphery package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts) includes a [`ContractRegistry`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-solidity-periphery-package-mirror/blob/master/flare/ContractRegistry.sol) library for interacting with the Flare Contract Registry.
This library provides a shorthand function to access smart contract interfaces.
The `ContractRegistry` library simplifies access to official contracts, so you donâ€™t need to remember their names, reducing the risk of typos.

In the following example, you can see the `FTSOV2Interface` contract that retrieves the address of the `FtsoV2Interface` interface using the `getFtsoV2` function from the `ContractRegistry` library on the Flare Coston2 network.

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="contracts/FTSOV2Interface.sol">
  {FTSOV2Interface}
</CodeBlock>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Remix fileName="FTSOV2Interface.sol">Open in Remix</Remix>
<br></br>

:::tip
If there is no shorthand function for the contract you need in the `ContractRegistry` library, you can use the `getContractAddressByName` function to get by name or the `getAllContracts` function to retrieve all the enshrined contracts.
