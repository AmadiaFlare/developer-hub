On Flare networks, contract addresses for enshrined protocol components such as `FtsoV2`, `FdcHub`, `WNat`, and others **should never be hardcoded**.
Instead, use the **Flare Contract Registry** to retrieve them dynamically.

:::warning
Developers should never rely on contract addresses from off-chain sources like direct messages, social media, or unofficial websites. These addresses may point to malicious contracts.

## Retrieving Addresses from the Blockchain

All core contract addresses can be retrieved from the [`FlareContractRegistry`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry) smart contract.  
This is the **only trusted source** of contract addresses provided in Flare documentation.

### Registry Contract Address

The Flare Contract Registry is deployed at the same address on [all networks](/network/solidity-reference):

| [FlareContractRegistry](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry) | `0xaD67FE66660Fb8dFE9d6b1b4240d8650e30F6019` |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

## Contract Registry Library

[Flare periphery package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts) includes a `ContractRegistry` library for interacting with the Flare Contract Registry.

In the following example, you can see the `FTSOV2Contract` contract that retrieves the address of the `FtsoV2` contract on the Flare Coston2 network.

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="contracts/FTSOV2Contract.sol">
  {FTSOV2Contract}
</CodeBlock>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Remix fileName="FTSOV2Contract.sol">Open in Remix</Remix>

### Library Functions

The `ContractRegistry` library provides the following functions:

#### `getAllContracts`

Retrieves all available enshrined contract names.

```solidity
function getAllContracts()
    internal view
    returns (string[] memory _names, address[] memory _addresses)
```

#### `getContractAddressByName`

Retrieves the address of a contract by its name.

```solidity
function getContractAddressByName(
    string memory _name
) internal view returns (address)
```

#### `getContractAddressByHash`

Retrieves the address of a contract by its hash.

```solidity
function getContractAddressByHash(
    bytes32 _nameHash
) internal view returns (address)
```

#### `getContractAddressesByName`

Retrieves the addresses of multiple contracts by their names.

```solidity
function getContractAddressesByName(
    string[] memory _names
) internal view returns (address[] memory)
```

#### `getContractAddressesByHash`

Retrieves the addresses of multiple contracts by their hashes.

```solidity
function getContractAddressesByHash(
    bytes32[] memory _nameHashes
) internal view returns (address[] memory)
```
