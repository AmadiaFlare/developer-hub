## Introduction

This guide will show you how to deposit and withdraw wrapped native tokens on Flare.
Wrapped tokens are required to delegate your vote power to FTSO data providers and to vote on decisions that affect how Flare networks operate.
Wrapped tokens are stored on the blockchain in an [`ERC-20`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) token standard in a smart contract called `WNat`.

The [`IWNat`](/network/solidity-reference/IWNat) contract is the interface for the Wrapped Native Token contract.

In this guide, we will use the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions to wrap and unwrap native tokens:

## Deposit

The `deposit` function wraps the amount of native tokens you specify in the field.

You can deposit native tokens on the Flare network using the `deposit` function in the following code:

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/wnat/deposit.ts">
  {Deposit}
</CodeBlock>

The most crucial function in the code above is the [`deposit`](/network/solidity-reference/IWNat#deposit) function from the `IWNat` contract.
With this function, you can deposit native tokens on Flare network and mint wrapped native tokens (WNAT) in return.

## Withdraw

Once you have wrapped native tokens, you can withdraw them using the [`withdraw`](/network/solidity-reference/IWNat#withdraw) function.
It unwraps the amount of native tokens you specify in the input field.

You can withdraw native tokens on the Flare network using the `withdraw` function using the following code:

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/wnat/withdraw.ts">
  {Deposit}
</CodeBlock>
<br />

You can deposit and withdraw wrapped native tokens to a specific address. Learn more in the [IWNat](/network/solidity-reference/IWNat) documentation.
